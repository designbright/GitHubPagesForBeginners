Learn how GitHub pages works and why it's important for every front-end project
*Note this process assumes the user already has a basic understanding of how GitHub (in general) works. 

## What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages (aka GH-Pages) is a way to create a website URL for people to easily view your raw HTML/CSS code as an actual website in a browser. GH-Pages is useful for front-end projects that are more visual in nature. GH-Pages is also useful if you are looking for a new job and you want employers to easily be able to see your projects in a browser. 

Pushing your project files to GitHub will display all the code in your HTML and CSS files. However, people won't be able to see the final product in the form of an actual website unless they cloned/forked your GitHub repo.

For example, you create an awesome website with HTML and CSS. You are able to test your code files on your computer in the browser and see what is actually rendering to the page. However, if you were to send your HTML file to someone, they would not be able to see the website. This is because you would be sending the file path from YOUR computer, which is not something your end user has access to.
